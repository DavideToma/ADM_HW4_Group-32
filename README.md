## Assignment
In this assignment we will perform a clustering analysis of house announcements in Rome from Immobiliare.it.

Then we will make the hash function for the password text to find the duplicates.

## What you will find in our repository:
1) `Homework_4_part1.ipynb`: a tidy Notebook where we put the code and the comments of our pipeline of the first part.
2) `Homework_4_part2.ipynb`: a tidy Notebook where we put the code and the comments of our pipeline of the second part.
3) `matrix2.zip`: the second matrix to don't run every time the code to get it.
4) `dataset.csv`: the dataset we obtained from the web scraping.
5) `mask.png`: the image to make the word cloud.
6) `immobiliareimg.jpg`: the image in the readme.txt

## Notes:

We implement the k-means class to get the bonus in the Homework_4_part1.ipynb .
